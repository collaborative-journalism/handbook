# The Collaborative Journalism Handbook

A guide of best practices and case studies for modern collaborative journalism.

The Collaborative Journalism Handbook was inspired by how the Internet and collaborative tools have made it easier not only for reporting teams to work together, but entire news organizations, despite the long-celebrated tradition of scooping competitors.
