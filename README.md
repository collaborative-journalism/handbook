# The Collaborative Journalism Handbook

A guide of best practices and case studies for modern collaborative and crowdsourced journalism.

The impetus for writing the *Collaborative Journalism Handbook* comes from the need to document the variety of scaleable, transparent, and wide-ranging journalism and best practices made possible by the Internet and collaborative software, similar to how the [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/) is the go-to reference for learning about the practice and people of data journalism.

Like the DJH, the *Collaborative Journalism Handbook* will be open-source and published online. Are you a collaborating journalist? Then fork this repo and add all the interesting content that's in my head.
